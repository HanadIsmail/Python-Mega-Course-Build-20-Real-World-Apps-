# 🐍 Python Mega Course Journey (60 Days)

Welcome to my learning journey through the **Python Mega Course** by **Ardit Sulce**.  
I’ve been following this 60-day challenge and documenting my assignments & projects step by step.  

---

## 📖 My Learning Progress

### 🔹 Days 1–15 (Completed ✅)
During the first 15 days, I covered the **fundamentals of Python** and built a strong base.  
Here’s what I learned and practiced:

- ✅ Python basics: variables, data types, operators  
- ✅ Control flow: `if`, `for`, `while`, logical conditions  
- ✅ Functions and scope  
- ✅ Working with lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries  
- ✅ String manipulation and formatting  
- ✅ File handling (read/write files)  
- ✅ Error handling with `try/except`  
- ✅ Introduction to modules and packages  
- ✅ Writing clean and reusable code  
- ✅ Solved daily assignments and mini-projects  

📌 All the code for **Day 1 → Day 15** is available in my GitHub repository.

### 🔹 From Day 15 Onwards
Now I am moving forward with more **intermediate and advanced topics** in Python.  
I’ll update this README every day with my new progress 🚀.
